                    Hi! I'm May, a full-stack web developer passionate about
                    building user-focused experiences that truly solve problems.
                    I believe great tech isn't just about looks â€” it's about
                    making people's lives easier and more intuitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before jumping into web development, I worked in finance,
                    where I discovered my love for coding through VBA and
                    building tools that help teams work smarter. Now, I'm
                    excited to bring that same problem-solving mindset to every
                    project I work on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I live in Dallas, Texas with my family, and when I'm not
                    coding, I enjoy spending time with them and playing video
                    games.
                </p>

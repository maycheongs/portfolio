    "description": "This is a full-stack web platform that I worked on with one other developer for non-technical users to upload training data, customize parameters and train ML models using the company's ML API. It was built with a React-based frontend with drag-and-drop UI, using Websockets, internationalization (I18next), and remote deployment via SSH (AWS). ChartJS for visualization of the model iterations and results as they were trained and fetched. Node.js/ Express backend with services for api integration and chunked data transfer, dataset management, emails, authentication and session management.",

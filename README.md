# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a showcase of my projects and skills built with modern web technologies. This project is an exploration of [Astro](https://astro.build/) for fast static site generation, and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a headless CMS for dynamic content management. It uses [React](https://react.dev/) for interactive components, [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for sleek icons and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for seamless deployment. The codebase is being transitioned to full [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

## About the Project
This portfolio serves as a professional hub to display my work, including web development projects, and personal experiments. It was built to learn and leverage Astro’s performance-focused architecture and Contentful’s flexible content management, with plans to fully adopt TypeScript for a robust developer experience.

### Tech Stack
- **Astro**: Static site generation for blazing-fast performance and SEO.
- **React**: Dynamic, reusable components for interactive UI.
- **Contentful**: Headless CMS for managing portfolio content (e.g., projects, bio).
- **Lucide React**: Lightweight, customizable icons.
- **TypeScript**: In-progress conversion for type-safe code (coming soon!).
- **Netlify**: Hosting and continuous deployment for a smooth live site.

## Features
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Astro’s static rendering ensures quick load times.
- **Dynamic Content**: Contentful powers easy updates to projects and content.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design with Lucide icons.

## TypeScript Transition
The project is actively being converted to TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability. This includes:
- Converting React components (`.jsx` to `.tsx`) with typed props.
- Adding TypeScript types for Contentful data models.
- Enhancing Astro pages with typed frontmatter.

## Deployment
The site is deployed on Netlify for automatic scaling and easy updates. Environment variables for Contentful are securely managed in Netlify’s dashboard.
